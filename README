This is a Linux utils for controlling FTDI-based LCD backpack designed
by dangerous prototypes
(http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/USB_Universal_LCD_backpack). Note
that Dangerous Prototypes has designed a newer LCD backpack that is
PIC-based, and much well supported. This utiles does not work with the
PIC-based LCD backpack.
