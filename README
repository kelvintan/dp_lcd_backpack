* Introduction
This is a Linux utility for controlling FTDI-based LCD backpack designed by Dangerous Prototypes (http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/USB_Universal_LCD_backpack). Note that Dangerous Prototypes has designed a newer LCD backpack that is PIC-based, and much well supported. This utility does not work with the PIC-based LCD backpack.

This program has only been tested on a 16x2 LCD (DE-LM12111) that I got from sure-electronics.com. I do not have the larger LCD, and hence could not add support for those LCD, e.g. 4-line LCD.

* Compile
- Requires libftdi (http://www.intra2net.com/en/developer/libftdi/)
- simply type make

* Usage 
- Require root privilege. If normal user account is use, the udev rule needs to be configured. A sample udev rule file is provided. Remember to edit the udev file to include s/no of your ft232r ic. The normal user need be part a member of the plugdev group, otherwise, simply change the group specified in the udev file.

- execute "./dp_lcd_backpack -h" for help
